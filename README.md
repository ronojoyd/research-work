In this repository, you'll find the machine learning code I developed, along with accompanying datasets and visualizations, which formed the backbone of my COVID-19 research projects at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). Under the guidance of Professors Preetam Ghosh and Satyaki Roy, I co-authored six research papers that delved into various aspects of the pandemic, from optimizing vaccine distribution across regions to harnessing NLP to assess the impact of COVID-19 on different job sectors.
